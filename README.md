## Installation üîß
To generate jar files run the following command in root path:

```
Wait a minute, when you see all containers running yo can launch the Spring Boot microservices:

### Microservice for command
Run the following command:

```

### Microservice for query
In other terminal run the following command:

```bash
java -jar demo-query/target/demo-query-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.original
```


Next step is download images of *Apache Kafka, Zoookeper and Mongo*. 

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

# Running project ‚öôÔ∏è
Once all microservice started you can test this serive using the command endpoint and service endpoint. I show you one example for POST and GET http rest requests with curl command:

```
curl --location --request POST 'localhost:8081/phone' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "iphone11",
    "model": "11",
    "color": "red",
    "price": 800.99
}'
```

```
curl --location --request GET 'localhost:8082/phone/iphone08'
```
